As you reach the chest it disappears before your 
eyes. You hear laughter behind you and suddenly 
see in the mirror the hideous reflection of a black- 
robed skeleton with green, translucent eyes, wear- 
ing a golden crown on its skull. You spin round but 
ifs too late. Zanbar Bone's skeletal fingers are 
touching your flesh and are draining your life away. 
You are now one of his undead servants.
