The guards are pleased that you have caught their 
wanted man. They tell you that he is an escaped 
murderer. The chief guard hands you 5 Gold Pieces, 
saying, 'Here's your reward. But you won't be 
getting another one - he won't escape again'. You 
watch for a short while as they lead the shouting 
murderer away, before continuing north along 
Stable Street.
