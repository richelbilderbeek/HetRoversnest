The Bays have difficulty in explaining themselves, 
but you manage to understand that one of the other 
team is going to throw the ball at you. You are 
handed the wooden stick and told that if you hit the 
ball over the wall, you will win the game for them.
Test your skill. 
Roll two dice. If the number rolled is equal to or less 
than your skill score, you hit the ball powerfully in 
the middle of the bat and watch it soar over the wall. If the number rolled is greater than 
your skill score, the ball goes whistling by your 
midriff as you swing, and a voice behind you calls, 
'You're out!'.
