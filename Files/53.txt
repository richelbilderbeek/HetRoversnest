The silk curtains in front of the archway are pulled 
aside and a strange creature steps into the room. It 
has a snake's head, which sits oddly atop the body 
of a young woman wearing a lavish gown. Its 
mouth opens and a forked tongue darts in and out 
as the Serpent Queen says, 'Don't try to fool me, I 
know that scoundrel Borryman never sends flowers. What silver gift have you brought me?' 
[1] If you have a silver item in your backpack that you wish to 
give to the Serpent Queen
[2] If you have not got a silver item that you wish to give away
