Her gaze is so hypnotic that you are unable to look 
away. You are defenceless and cannot resist as she 
embraces you and slowly sinks her fangs into your 
neck to drink your blood. You drift into an uncon- 
scious sleep, and iv hen you awake you are unaware 
of your previous existence - you have become a 
Vampire yourself!
