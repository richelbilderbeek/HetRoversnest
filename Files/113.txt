You enter the house and find yourself standing in a 
room full of toys. But they are not ordinary toys. 
These are stuffed creatures with nails through their 
heads, dolls' houses that are made lo look as if they 
are on fire, and many other unpleasant objects. In 
the middle of the room stand two old women dressed as 
though they were little girls. They are squabbling over a carved wooden duck. Each looks eager 
to destroy the duck with the knives they are holding. On seeing you the women both start to shout, 
'Give us toys! Give us toys!' 
[1] If you wish to give them something from your backpack
[2] If you would rather leave these strange old ladies and 
continue east
