You reach the top of the ladder and peer over the 
handrail to survey the ship's deck. There are two 
large masts rising into the air from the deck. 
Wooden boxes, barrels and coils of rope lie all 
around, and one of the ship's crew stands on guard 
at the top of the gangplank. In the centre of the deck 
there is a small cabin with an open door. Through 
the door you see stairs leading down to the lower 
decks. 
[1] If you wish to inspect any of the wooden boxes and barrels, you will have to deal with the pirate on guard
[2] If you wish to creep along the deck to the stairs
