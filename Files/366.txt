You pay for the smoking mixture and leave the 
shop- Outside you pack your pipe with the smoking 
mixture and light it. The smoke is dark and tastes 
awful. You start to cough and your chest is gripped 
by a terrible pain. Lose 2 stamina points. You 
are unable to stop coughing, so you sit down on the 
street and try to calm down. You slump down 
against a wall between two barrels and gradually 
the coughing subsides.
